# Medical No-Show Prediction Project

A data analysis project exploring patterns and factors that influence whether patients attend or miss their medical appointments, using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
This project explores patterns and factors that influence whether patients attend or miss their medical appointments. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain insights into appointment no-shows.

## Dataset
The dataset contains appointment details, patient demographics, and other relevant information used to investigate trends and predictors of no-shows.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Analysis of factors like age, neighborhood, and scheduling gaps affecting no-shows
- Insights to help improve appointment adherence

## How to Run
